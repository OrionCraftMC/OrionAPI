# OrionCraft

PvP client & cross-version modloader for legacy outdated Minecraft version.

This project was inspired by all the amazing work made by Lunar Client and it's developers.

###### This is not intended to be released as a standalone client and compete in the pvp client space, but rather to be a project for me to explore modding of old and obsolete versions.
